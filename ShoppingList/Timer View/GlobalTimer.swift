// with a timer in this the app, it's a real question of whether the timer should be
// stopped when you switch to a different app or get a phone call.  so, you decide.
// in my own case, i would not want to disable the timer if i am on the phone when
// i am in the store because it's probably part of the "shopping experience" if i
// have to call my wife with a question about which brand of salad dressing to get.
// this boolean determines this behaviour (so my preference is "false")
//
// note: if you don't disable the timer when in the background, what we're really
// doing is remembering when we went into the background; killing the timer; and
// when we become active again, we recreate the timer and set the startDate of the
// timer to either the current date, or the date when we were previously stopped.

	// -- calling reset() does not change state, just resets time counters
	// -- calling start() moves to the .running state
	//
	// .running:
	// -- upon entry, creates a timer to call back every 1 second and increment totalAccumulatedTime
	//      and remembers when it starts (either "now" or "when i last shut down") according
	//      to the value of kDisableTimerWhenAppIsNotActive
	// -- calling stop() shuts down the timer and moves back to the .stopped state
	// -- calling suspend() moves into the .suspended state
	//
	// .suspsended:
	// -- upon entry, shuts down the timer, updates totalAccumulatedTime, and remembers its shutdown date
	// -- calling start() moves to the .running state
