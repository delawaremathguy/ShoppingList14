/*-- IGNORE -------------------------------------------------------------------------
in the previous design of this app, there were no @ObservedObject references to Items.
however, the ShoppingListTabView and the PurchasedItemsTabView need to be updated, and
these views are driven by @FetchRequests.

problem: sending on objectWillChange message is not picked up by a @FetchRequest. but
an @FR is based on NSFetchedResultsController and reacts to changes to Core Data attributes
only (it does not observe its objects like an @ObservableObject would)

so i will trick these views into updating by "making a change" to each Item entity
associated with this Location (!)  WARNING: it's a little bit of a hack.

but what do you change? we'll reset each Item's location to be this location.
and this works!  the assignment is picked up by Core Data and @FetchRequests
that involve these items.
		
	items.forEach({ $0.location_ = self })
	}

}
