	/* Discussion
	
	Notice that all except one of the Core Data attributes on an Item that
	appear in the CD model with an underscore (_) at the end of their name.
	(the only exception is "id" because tweaking that name is a problem because
	of conformance to Identifiable.)
	
	my general theory of the case is that no one outside of this class should really
	be touching these attributes directly, especially SwiftUI views.  apart from
	smoothing out the awkwardness of nil-coalescing in some cases, these are some
	attributes of an Item which, when changed, not only generate a reactive effect
	out there in SwiftUI views that watch for Item changes (e.g., via a @FetchRequest
	of as an @Observed object) -- but also should trigger a reactive effect on
	some SwiftUI views that involve the item's associated location.
	
	the same is true for Locations.  changing an attribute of a Location directly may at
	times require triggering a SwiftUI reaction involving the items associated with the Location.
	
	example: the ShoppingListTabView creates SelectableItemRowView structs for SwiftUI, and
	each displays information about an item, including the associated location's name.  we
	get the location's name using a computed property on Item that cleanly nil-coalesces the value.
	
	importantly, these SelectableItemRowView views are routinely created and destroyed, and they
	will (only) get redrawn if the @FetchRequest that drives the ShoppingListTabView gets an
	objectWillChange.send() from an Item.
	
	here, then, is the problem: if you change a Location's name, the locationName computed
	property of each associated Item now has been updated and those SelectableItemRowViews
	must get redrawn.  so each item associated with the location must generate an
	objectWillChange.send() message.  (in fact, i think only one item need to do this ...)
	
	also, think what happens when you change a location's visitationOrder.  potentially, that
	causes the entire ShoppingListTabView to restructure itself; that won't happen unless
	changing a location's visitationOrder also generates some item.objectWillChange.send().

	// this sequence of deletion is a little tricky to understand !
	// deleting an item in Core Data doesn't really delete it ... it sort of hangs around
	// a little bit, eventually getting removed (likely in the next available event loop, if
	// that's what they still call it).  what you can find, in some cases, is a zombine reference
	// to a deleted object for which .isDeleted is false and .isFault is true -- but it will
	// shortly go away from the CD memory graph when CD gets caught up with all changes.
	//
	// this is a real problem for SwiftUI.  if any view is holding a reference to a
	// deleted CD object, and its body property is called by SwiftUI using that reference,
	// you have problems, so its particularly helpful if you always nil-coalesce CD optionals
	// (asking for item.name_! when item has been deleted will cause a force-unwrap, because
	// the item's in-memory representation has been zeroed out and name_ is nil).
	// ... see the Discussion above!
	//
	// the typical problem is this: View A is driven by a @FetchRequest for Items; it
	// draws a list of those items, with each item appearing in its own subview, View B, for which
	// the item is marked as an @ObservedObject.  an item is deleted here; View A detects the change,
	// but apparently doesn't yet know about the deletion until CD tidies itself up. View A redraws,
	// causing View B to be re-evaluated with a now, non-existent object.
	//
	// so i now make a call to processPendingChanges() to sync up the object graph in memory
	// right away.  this, apparently, is enough to avoid most problems.  unfortunately,
	// there may still be a little work to do in the future on this, so using nil-coalescing
	// code is highly recommended.
	//
	// one note here: we'll assume you want to save this change by default.
