import SwiftUI

// this is a struct to centralize the data needed to run the confirmation alerts
// that i use whenever the user want to perform a destructive action, in these cases:
//
// (1) move all items off the list in the ShoppingListTabView (a user might touch
// this button accidentally and lose the whole shopping list)
//
// (2) delete an item (in either the ShoppingListTabView or the PurchasedItemsTabView)
//
// (3) delete a location (in the LocationsTabView)
//
// on this case-by-case basis, we provide an appropriate Alert struct with the
// proper messages and execute the apporpriate destructive action when the user
// confirms the action.

struct ConfirmationAlert {

		// an appropriate default, but it should never trigger
		case none
		
		// the ShoppingListTabView needs this type
		case moveAllOffShoppingList
		
		// the ShoppingListTabView, PurchasedItemsTabView, and AddOrModifyItemView
		// need this type, along with the item to delete
		case deleteItem(Item)
		
		// the LocationsTabView and AddOrModifyLocationView
		// need this type, along with the location to delete
		case deleteLocation(Location)

	// the type of this confirmation alert
	var type: ConfirmationAlertType
	
	// whether the Alert we provide is showing, i.e., its boolean-valued trigger.
	// .alert always uses such a boolean
	var isShowing: Bool = false
	
	// and a completion handler for after we do what we do. the AddOrModify views
	// need this so they can run the alert, delete an Item or Location, and then
	// follow that by dismissing themselves after executing the deletion
	var completion: (() -> ())?
	
	// once the user wants to perform a destructive action, just call the trigger function,
	// setting its type (and any necessary associated data) and perhaps tacking on an
	// optional completion handler, depending on the call site
