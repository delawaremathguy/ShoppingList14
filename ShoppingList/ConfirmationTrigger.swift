// this is a struct to centralize the data needed to run the confirmation alert
// that we use to confirm that the user intends to
//
// (1) move all items off the list in the ShoppingListTabView (they might hit
// this button accidentally and lose the whole shopping list) or
//
// (2) delete an item (in either the ShoppingListTabView or the PurchasedItemsTabView) or
//
// (3) delete a location (in the LocationsTabView)
//
// on this case-by-case basis, we provide an appropriate Alert struct with the
// proper messages and execute the apporpriate destructive action when the user
// confirms the action.
