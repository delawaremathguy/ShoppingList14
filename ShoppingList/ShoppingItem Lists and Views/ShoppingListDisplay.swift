// MARK: - A Generic SectionData struct

// the notion of this struct is that we use it to tell us what to draw for a single
// section: its title and the items to show in the section.
struct SectionData: Identifiable, Hashable {
	var id: Int { hashValue }
	let title: String

// MARK: - ShoppingListView

// this is a subview of the ShoppingListTabView and shows itemsToBePurchased
// as either a single section or as multiple sections, one section for each Location.
// it uses a somewhat intricate, but standard,Form/ForEach/Section/ForEach construct
// to present the list in sections and requires some preliminary work to perform the
// sectioning.
//
// each item that appears has a NavigationLink to a detail view and a contextMenu
// associated with it; actions from the contextMenu may require bringing up an alert,
// but we will not do that here in this view.  we will simply set @Binding variables
// from the parent view appropriately and let the parent deal with it (e.g., because
// the parent uses the same structure to present an alert already to move all items
// of the list).
struct ShoppingListView: View {
	
	// this is the @FetchRequest that ties this view to CoreData Items
	// comment: this is a subview of the parent ShoppingListTabView, which
	// already has its own @FetchRequest to drive that view.  we could "pass"
	// that into this subview, but there are some syntax subtleties; plus, it's
	// easier to just think of this as a view that takes care of itself, except for
	// having the two @Binding hooks back to the main view.

	// this is a temporary holding array for items being moved to the other list.  it's a
	// @State variable, so if any SelectableItemRowView or a context menu adds an Item
	// to this array, we will get some redrawing + animation; and we'll also have queued
	// the actual execution of the move to the purchased list to follow after the animation
	// completes -- and that deletion will again change this array and redraw.
