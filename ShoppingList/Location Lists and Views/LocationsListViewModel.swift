// a LocationsListViewModel object provides a window into the Code Data store that
// can be used by LocationsTabView.  it provides both data out for the view to consume,
// and handles user intents from the View
// back to Core Data (with notification to the View that the viewModel has changed).

class LocationsListViewModel: ObservableObject {
	
	// the items on our list
	@Published var locations = [Location]()
	
	// quick access to count
	var locationCount: Int { locations.count }
	
	// have we ever been loaded or not
	private var dataHasBeenLoaded = false

	
	init() {
		// sign us up for several change operations that could have an effect on the
		// LocationsTabView that we assist.  these are obviously any changes to locations
//		NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(locationAdded),
//																					 name: .locationAdded, object: nil)
		NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(locationEdited),
																					 name: .locationEdited, object: nil)
		NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(locationWillBeDeleted),
																					 name: .locationWillBeDeleted, object: nil)
		
		// but we also have to watch for deletions of ShoppingItems (see explanation below)
		// or changes to a ShoppingItem's location
		// because we display the number of items at a Locations
		NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(shoppingItemWillBeDeleted),

		// we do not need to watch for shopping items being added here because such an addition
		// cannot take place while we are "in the LocationsTabView."
		
		// THIS BRINGS UP AN INTERESTING SUBTLETY ABOUT A VIEWMODEL. it needs to be aware of any
		// change in the model that affects the view.  it's not just about the array of objects
		// represented, but about ANY aspect of the model that's displayed, even if an object
		// itself has not changed.  when the Locations tab is chosen, a shopping item can still be
		// edited (tap location -> tap item in list of items at the location -> edit the item); and
		// while the LocationsTabView shows no information about specific shopping item data, it does
		// show the number of items at the Location. so a deletion or an edit could affect the display.
