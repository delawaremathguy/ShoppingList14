// the app will hold a variable of type Today, which keeps track of the "start of
// today."  the PurchasedItemsTabView needs to know what "today" means to properly
// section out its data, and it would seem to make sense that the PurchasedItemsTabView
// should handle that by itself.  however, if you push the app into the background
// when the PurchasedItemsTabView is showing and then bring it back a few days later,
// the PurchasedItemsTabView will show the same display as when it went into the background
// and not know about the change; so its view will need to be updated.  that's why
// this is here: the app certainly knows when it becomes active, and so can update what
// "today" means, and the PurchasedItemsTabView will pick up on that in its environment
class Today: ObservableObject {
	@Published var start: Date = Calendar.current.startOfDay(for: Date())
	func update() {
		let newStart = Calendar.current.startOfDay(for: Date())
		if newStart != start {
			start = newStart
		}
	}
}

// this is (approximately) the new App structure for iOS 14 that's been
// cobbled together based on comments on the Apple Developer Forums
// see https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/650876
// and although i have left the old AppDelegate and SceneDelegate
// files in the project, i have removed them from the project.
